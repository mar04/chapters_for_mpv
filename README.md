# chapters for mpv

It's a script that lets you add, remove and edit chapters of the currently
played media, be it video or audio, local file or a stream. Chapters you create
can be saved into a separate text file and automatically loaded when you open
the same media file again.

## Features

* add a new chapter, optionally with a title
* edit existing chapter's title
* remove current chapter
* save chapters as a text file, either in the same directory as the media file
  or in a global directory
* optionally can read a specified XATTR and/or hash file paths in an attempt to
  uniquely identify media files if chapter files are stored in a central
  directory
* option to automatically save/load chapter files
* option to use ffmpeg to put the chapters into the media file container as a
  metadata, so that other media players, like vlc, can make use of them
* should work on Unix and Windows (tested on Archlinux and Windows 10)

## Installation

* place **main.lua** in the **~/.config/mpv/scripts/chapters/** directory, where
  **chapters** is used as the name of this script
* optionally create a config file named **chapters.conf** (which must match the
  name of the directory as used above) in **~/.config/mpv/scripts-opts**, check
  out example config file
* add keybindings to your **~/.config/mpv/input.conf**, example:

  ```ini
  n       script-binding chapters/add_chapter
  ctrl+m  script-binding chapters/remove_chapter
  ctrl+.  script-binding chapters/edit_chapter
  N       script-binding chapters/write_chapters
  ctrl+,  script-binding chapters/bake_chapters
  ```

* if you want to have the ability to name/rename chapters, you'll need to install
  <https://github.com/CogentRedTester/mpv-user-input>

  * optionally create a config file for it **~/.config/mpv/user_input.conf** where
  you can configure text size and such

## Thanks

* <https://github.com/CogentRedTester/mpv-user-input> - very useful script to get
  user input, hopefully one day mpv's scripting API will have that ootb.
* <https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-createchapter> - inspiration for writing this
  script. At first I just wanted to add to it the ability to load the saved
  chapters file, but then I wrote entirely new script with a lot more features.
  Also check out <https://github.com/dyphire/mpv-scripts> - as I was finishing
  my script and thinking how to name it, I found out that someone already wrote
  something similar. Duh... at least I got to lear some Lua in the process.
* mpv, ffmpeg and other awesome open source projects
